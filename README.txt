1)  Compile the TreeEncryptionTester.java.  
2)  Run the compiled TreeEncryptionTester program
3)  Enter 1 for encryption
4)  Enter the name of the tree to be used
5)  Enter one of the four message files to be encrypted (msg1,msg2,msg3,msg4)
6)  The output file contains the now encrypted message file.
